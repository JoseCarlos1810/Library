# Library
This project is a C++ library management system that uses object-oriented programming to manage a collection of books of different genres, such as fiction and science, and it also manage the users who use the library. This system allows the user to find the information about a book and registers whether the user takes the book home or not. This project demonstrates the application of object-oriented programming.
# Why?
I will develop a library management system because it will make easier to go to a library, search for a book in the system and when a user takes the book home, it will appear in the system. With this system, the time needed to manage the books will be significantly reduced. At the same time, this project will put my programming skills to the test and give me the opportunity to practice everything I will learn since the start until the final of this project 
# How?
To make possible this library management system I will use classes, objects, arrays, files, matrices, conditionals, loops and basic functions. The classes will help to manage all the different gender of books and users of the library, the arrays will help to introduce all the information of each book and user, the conditionals will be used to know if the user takes home a book and to know what kind of gender he is looking for, the others will do differents things to help with the management of the library.
# Classes
### Library
Is the center classe, where the different genders of book are, it is also where is the users info
### Books
Represents the common properties of the different genders
### Fiction
Represents the fiction gender
### Science
Represents the science gender
### Users
Represents the users of the library, it also define if the user takes or not the book to his house
