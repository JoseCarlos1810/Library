# Library
This project is a C++ library management system that uses object-oriented programming to manage a collection of books of different genres, such as fiction and science, and it also manage the users who use the library. This system allows the user to find the information about a book and registers whether the user takes the book home or not. This project demonstrates the application of object-oriented programming.
# Why?
I will develop a library management system because it will make easier to go to a library, search for a book in the system and when a user takes the book home, it will appear in the system. With this system, the time needed to manage the books will be significantly reduced. At the same time, this project will put my programming skills to the test and give me the opportunity to practice everything I will learn since the start until the final of this project
